birth_year = input( " Enter your birth year: ")
# age = 2020 - birth_year
# this will show you an error coz we are inputing a string value
# and subtracting it from an int value
age = 2020 - int (birth_year)
print ( age )

int(birth_year)  
# by this way we type caste the string value into an int value 

# similarly others are 
int()
float()
bool()
str()
